It's a brand new day, Sunshine!

Hey now hey now this is what dreams are made of.

Lah di dah di, we like to party!

Dancing with Molly doing whatever we want

This our house this our rules

& we can't stop & we won't stop

Can't you see that its we who own the night

Can't you see it's we who bout that life
